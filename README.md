# Cyclistic Bike-share Report
## In this analysis, the Cyclistic Bike-share Marketing Team want to develop a strategy to convert casual riders into annual membership riders. To do so, I joined the Q1 2019 and Q1 2020 data to determine trends such as average ride time and user type count. I joined the tables and cleaned the data for consistency.

# Visualisation
## I did data visualisation using Tableau, which can be accessed here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bryon.kimatia/viz/CyclisticBike-SharePerformanceQ12019andQ12020/Dashboard1?publish=yes
